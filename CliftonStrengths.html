    <h1>My Clifton Strength Finder Journey</h1>
    <p>One of the most valuable experiences of my military career was taking part in <a href="https://www.honor.org">The Honor Foundation.</a><br>
    This three month program took transitioning members of the Special Operations community through an arduous journey of self-exploration.<br>
During the first month, fellows spent a great deal of time examining not only our Why, but our true motivations, and driving force behind our next<br>
mission. We found that most of us spend much more time planning a month long training exercise than we do preparing for our retirement.  But before<br>
we could dive into our motivations, we needed to have a much more meaningful understanding about ourselves.<br>
After taking the 177 question test, I started working with a professional coach who helped me see my attributes for what they were. These were my<br>
top five results: <b>Learner, Achiever, Stragetic, Relator, Intellection.  </b>

            <p><b>Learner:</b>   It’s very likely that you acquire knowledge more easily when you can talk with others about ideas, concepts<br>
                , or theories.Thoughts come alive for you when questions are posed and answers are proposed. You have a delightful time  <br>
                thinking out loud and listening to intelligent people express themselves. You naturally document or store in your mind bits <br>
                 of discussions. You want to refer back to these insights or facts whenever the opportunity presents itself. Because of <br>
                 and pieces your strengths, you are scholarly, especially when you have an important goal to reach. You are willing to examine <br>
                 relevant topics for extended periods of time. You are determined to satisfy your need for knowledge as well as your <br>
                 desire to make measurable progress. Instinctively, you prefer having quiet time to mull over ideas as well as read <br>
                and examine interesting topics. Periods of uninterrupted thinking give you great pleasure. You probably excuse yourself <br>
                from noisy, active, or distracting situations to thoroughly process your ideas. Driven by your talents, you sometimes <br>
                rely on reason to determine how an event, decision, or condition led to a specific event. Perhaps you desire to <br>
                understand how things converge to produce the final result. Chances are good that you concentrate for extended periods <br>
                of time. This is one reason why you ultimately master skills and grasp concepts.</p>

            <p><b>Achiever:</b>    By nature, you possess the physical and mental endurance to withstand hardships as well as stress. <br>
                Characteristically you work harder and longer than most people are capable of doing. It’s very likely that you naturally  <br>
                 thinking about data and measurements. You aim to understand what the numbers really mean. You certainly seek <br>
                 expend mental energy explanations from those who performed the original calculations. Chances are good that you do much   <br>
                 more than just try to live up to your commitments. You persist working until you can deliver on your promises. This  <br>
                 certainly enhances your reputation for being trustworthy, reliable, and dependable. Driven by your talents, you sometimes <br>
                 enjoy launching new initiatives. Perhaps you have a reputation for knowing how to get projects moving forward. <br>
                 Because of your strengths, you earnestly apply yourself to seeing things as they really are. You bring a practical,<br>
                  matter-of-fact, and unsentimental outlook to various discussions, projects, or planning meetings.

            <p><b>Strategic:</b>    Chances are good that you may be inclined to examine the basic elements of certain types of problems.<br>
                 You might attempt to understand how and why things work or fail to work. These insights might stimulate your thinking.<br>
                  Then you try to generate a few alternative plans. Considering prevailing circumstances, available resources, and time <br>
                  constraints, you might narrow down your options. Perhaps the plan that offers the best chance of solving the problem <br>
                  naturally reveals itself. Instinctively, you occasionally marvel at your ability to vividly express your thoughts and<br>
                   feelings. Because of your strengths, you analyze the lessons of the past to find clues for handling future situations.<br>
                    Piecing together the causes and effects of historical events allows you to discover alternate routes to your goal.<br>
                     You are seldom taken by surprise. Why? You probably have studied your options and crafted innovative solutions.<br>
                      Driven by your talents, you long to know more so you remain on the cutting edge of your field or areas of interest.<br>
                       Your inventive mind usually generates more possibilities than you can handle or fund. Nonetheless, you are <br>
                       committed to acquiring knowledge and/or skills. You study everything involved in a situation and conceive <br>
                       entirely new ways of seeing or doing things. What you already know prompts you to ask questions and delve <br>
                       even deeper into a subject or problem. It’s very likely that you may have little difficulty finding the right<br>
                        words at the right time to express what you are thinking or feeling. Maybe you can present your concepts in<br>
                         a reasonable, orderly, or methodical way. Perhaps you generate a few options for others to consider. As a <br>
                         result, certain individuals might say you know how to get your ideas across to people.

            <p><b>Relator:</b>    By nature, you trust your intuition about what someone is thinking, feeling, or needing. You realize<br>
                  that the answers and solutions to many problems spontaneously reveal themselves to you. Your friends frequently ask <br>
                  what you would recommend. They often seek your guidance. Driven by your talents, you feel most fulfilled when you are <br>
                  busy and simply performing routine tasks. When you have nothing to do, typically you find something to do. Sitting <br>
                  around and wasting time does not suit you at all. Instinctively, you are regularly sought out by others for your <br>
                  expert counsel. A variety of people ask for your opinions and suggestions. Once individuals realize you possess the <br>
                  precise knowledge and skills they need, they come to you for guidance. Because of your strengths, you can instruct, <br>
                  guide, train, or tutor individuals. You are likely to stay within your area of specialization, however. People probably<br>
                   notice how confident you are when you share your knowledge or demonstrate your skills. It’s very likely that you may <br>
                   notice that some members of your group ask you to share your convictions, conclusions, or values. Sometimes they want<br>
                    to understand your position about certain topics, people, issues, or situations. When you express your views, certain<br>
                     individuals might feel they know you a little bit better.</p>

            <p><b>Intellection:</b>  Because of your strengths, you sometimes enjoy socializing. Maybe you are stimulated by the company<br>
                 of particular individuals. Interestingly, you might be just as comfortable spending time alone thinking through <br>
                 things. By nature, you gravitate to conversations in which intelligent, unemotional, and reasonable thoughts are <br>
                 freely exchanged. These give-and-take sessions inspire you to consider what you need to upgrade, perfect, or raise <br>
                 to excellence. It’s very likely that you occasionally spend time alone thinking about which individuals work well <br>
                 together. Perhaps your thoughtful examination of each human being allows you to mix and match the strengths of several<br>
                  individuals. Sometimes the strengths of one person compensate for the limitations of another person, and vice versa.<br>
                   You might conclude that a group’s true strength lies in the diversity of its members’ knowledge, skills, motivations,<br>
                    work styles, or thinking styles. Instinctively, you may reserve several hours a week to ponder what you have read,<br>
                     seen or heard. Perhaps you set aside one-hour blocks of time just to think or use smaller blocks of time to your<br>
                      advantage. For example, you might reflect on certain ideas as you walk, bicycle, drive or otherwise commute to<br>
                       and from your job or classes. Chances are good that you enjoy reflecting on what you already know and on what<br>
                        you want to know. Your concentration leads you to major and minor discoveries. You need ample quiet time to<br>
                         critically examine new information, theories, concepts, or philosophies. Wherever you go and whatever you do,<br>
                          your mind is seldom at rest. You consider what you have observed. You pose never-before-asked questions.<br>
                           Thinking deeply about things is a necessity for you. It is not a luxury. It is not an option.
